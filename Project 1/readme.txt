					SOCAIL NETWORK ANALYSIS


Steps for running the code:

Our objective here is to study the social network of the two prominent election candidates â€“ Joe Biden(Democratic) and Donald J. Trump(Republican).
1)Initially open the code in Jupyter Notebook.
2)Then insert all the details for consumer key,consumer secret, access token and access token secret that we acquired from the Twitter Developer Account..
3)Tweepy is used to collect the data from Twitter API and networkx was used to visualize the network.
4)Access the twitter data of all the candidates and their friends with the help of candidate ids.
5)Plot a histogram of the degree distribution and calculate the network measures degree centrality,Eigenvector Centrality and betweenness centrality.
6)Run all the cells and we can get all the graphs and the network measures values.
Social network analysis of Donald Trump and Joe Biden gave a strong indication that they are the frontrunners from Republicans and Democrats respectively.
